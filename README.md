Project 1 Proposal

### Members: Beverly Thompson, Clark Pfifer

- Topic: Dividend-Oriented Stocks
- Databases used: Kaggle

### Questions to answer:
- What are the top 10 highest-returning dividend stocks in the given dataset (monthly)?

- What are the quantifiable impacts on stocks between March 2020 to the present?

    Null: If the defined COVID range (March 2020-present) does not impact dividend stock payments, then there will be not be a dividend stock percentage change exceeding a factor of 5 percent. 
    
    Alternative: If the defined COVID range (March 2020-present) does impact dividend stock payments, then there will be a dividend stock percentage change exceeding a factor of 5 percent. 


### Hypotheses:


Title: Taking Stock- Dividends v Growth

Outline: Our presentation will be focused on the performance statistics of dividend stocks and overall stock growth metrics in a 2-year timespan.

Definitions:
-Cash/Stock Dividend: (either in the form of cash or other means of payment) a payment to a stock owner as their prerogative as a shareholder

-Liquidation: any means of turning stock value into usable currency

-Yields are the dividend amount divided by price of stock share. Last day of each month used for price variable.


### Scope/Limits:
- When: 1/1/2018-Present
### Task Breakdowns:
- Access Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/tsaustin/us-historical-stock-prices-with-earnings-data?select=dataset\_summary.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/tsaustin/us-historical-stock-prices-with-earnings-data?select=dataset_summary.csv) for up-to-date financial findings.
- Limit data findings to 1/1/2018 to present
- Identify top performing dividend stocks:
    - Overall
    - Pre-March 2020
    - March 2020-Present
- Examine dividend stocks and dividend yields:
    - Overall
    - Pre-March 2020
    - March 2020-Present

### Roles:
- Clark: Strengths are more on the side of what I describe as "What humans will read". So, while I will do my best to help in coding through our datasets, my input will be best focused in the written analysis and how visualizations will appear for presentation.
- Beverly: Beverly will be more focused on the actual data analysis of the links provided.
